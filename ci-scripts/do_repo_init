# In order to get repo tool to be able to init from pull-requests, there
# has to be a branch available in /refs/heads. This is facilitated by
# syncing the git repositroy on the host (in which this file is located) into
# the vagrant machine. The git repository is fetched from the host since the
# host already fetched the correct refs via the Jenkinsfile.

# Copy the host repo to ensure that no later git commands destroy anything.
